The _power_of_inquestition_ is simply the asking of uncomfortable questions to those in or influence power -- political, social, technical, et al...

Historically reporters would report on facts of an issue and inform their readers so the polity could better keep themselves informed. 

Unfortunately becuase of a failing of Journalistic Ethics, journalist today only report the facts they, their employers, or the Ruling Regime desires. Due to this failing, we training a new generation of factfinders or Inquisitors -- people who ask questions in order to get to the Truth of a matter. 

If you wish to help inform the public of issues you can contribute to our Inqusition by:

- sharing the True Name of the demons we are exorcizing
- learning Markdown and writing articles for Allied Inititives
-
